ScalaForTheImpatient
====================
Project created to learn Scala basics by solving all the scala exercises proposed by the well known [ScalaForTheImpatient](http://www.horstmann.com/scala/index.html) book.

Solved exercises
----------------
Exercises have been solved with unit tests. You can find out all the solutions in the "src/test/scala/" directory.
You will not find a test for all the exercises, as some of them are theoretical. In addition, some practical exercises
need a theoretical answer too. In those cases, the answer is included in the documentation of the exercise object class.

Each exercise class is intentionally declared as an `Object` to provide a simple syntax for method calls (like the one
for static methods in Java): `Exercise10.takeLastThreeElementsFrom("Hello")`.

The following chapters have been completed and uploaded:

* **Chapter 1:** The Basics
* **Chapter 2:** Control Structures and Functions
