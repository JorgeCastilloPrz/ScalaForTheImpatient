ScalaForTheImpatient
====================
Project created to learn Scala basics by solving all the scala exercises proposed by the well known [ScalaForTheImpatient](http://www.horstmann.com/scala/index.html) book.

Solved exercises
----------------
The exercises have been solved by using unit testing. You can find out all the solutions in the "src/test/scala/" directory. Some of the exercises have not
been solved by using a test as they are theoretical. In addition, theoretical answers to non-theoretical exercises are attached to the class documentation of the
exercise object file.

* **Chapter 1:** The Basics
* **Chapter 2:** Control Structures and Functions
